                    <p class="">
                        In most cases, you have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you. If
                        you
                        wish to access your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer by emailing:
                        support@reventure.co.</p>
                    <p>We will deal with all requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible.
                        Requests
                        for a large amount of information, or information which is not currently in use, may require
                        further
                        time before a response can be given. We may charge you a reasonable fee for access if a cost is
                        incurred by us in order to retrieve your information, but in no case will we charge you a fee
                        for
                        your application for access. Whenever a fee will be applied, you will be notified of how that
                        fee
                        will be calculated, or where possible, the total amount that will be charged. You will then have
                        the
                        option to decide whether to proceed with your access request.</p>
                    <p>In some cases, we will refuse to give you access to personal information we hold about you. This
                        includes, but is not limited to, circumstances where denying access is required or authorised by
                        or
                        under American law or a court/tribunal order or where giving you access would: be unlawful; have
                        an
                        unreasonable impact on other people’s privacy; prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity;
                        reveal our intentions in relation to negotiations with you so as to prejudice those
                        negotiations;
                        prejudice enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body;
                        reveal
                        evaluative information generated within the ReVenture business in connection with a commercially
                        sensitive decision-making process.</p>
                    <p>We will also refuse access where the personal information relates to existing or anticipated
                        legal
                        proceedings, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those
                        proceedings. Further, we will refuse access where your request is frivolous or vexatious, and
                        where
                        we reasonably believe that: giving access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or
                        safety
                        of any individual, or to public health or public safety; unlawful activity, or misconduct of a
                        serious nature, is being or may be engaged in against ReVenture and giving access would be
                        likely to
                        prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to that matter.</p>
                    <p>If we refuse to give you access we will provide you with reasons for our refusal, unless doing so
                        would be unreasonable in the circumstances. We will also take reasonable steps to give you
                        access in
                        a way that meets your needs without giving rise to the reasons of our refusal. Further, we will

                        statement that you view it as inaccurate, out of date, incomplete or misleading.</p>
                    <p class="">In the case we have corrected personal information about you, you may request that we
                        take
                        reasonable steps to give notice of the correction to any third party to which we have disclosed
                        the
                        inaccurate, out of date, incomplete or misleading personal information.</p>

                        information.</p>
